# Plant-Species-Classification


Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?

The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, had released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The list of species is as follows:

Black-grass

Charlock

Cleavers

Common Chickweed

Common wheat

Fat Hen

Loose Silky-bent

Maize

Scentless Mayweed

Shepherds Purse

Small-flowered Cranesbill

Sugar beet


Project Objective: University X is currently undergoing some research to understand characteristics of plant and plant seedlings. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.
